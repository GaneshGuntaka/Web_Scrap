## 📊 Data Visualization Insights
### **Univariate Analysis**
- **Price Distribution:** Most TVs fall between ₹15K–₹35K → strong mid-range demand.  
- **Screen Type:** Ultra HD (4K) models dominate the listings.

### **Bi-variate Analysis**
- **Price vs Rating:** No strong correlation — affordable TVs can also have high ratings.  
- **Average Rating by Screen Type:** 4K TVs slightly outperform HD Ready models.

### **Multi-variate Analysis**
- **Brand vs Screen Type vs Price:**  
  Premium brands (Sony, Samsung) dominate high-end 4K segments,  
  while budget brands (realme, Coocaa) lead in affordable HD models.

- **Discount vs Rating:**  
  Moderate discounts (30–50%) often yield higher ratings.
